 My name is Henrique Oliveira. I am a full stack software engineer based in London. My background is mostly in Java with a bit of JavaScript, but recently I've been diving deep into [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

 I used to live in Germany, where I developed software for institutions like the [European Space Agency](http://esa.int/) and [EUMETSAT](http://www.eumetsat.int/). [Past projects](/cv) include backend and web development, a bit of iOS development and [some dabbling in artificial intelligence](/publications).

 This website is built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
